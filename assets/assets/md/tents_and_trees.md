# Tents and Trees (WIP)

This is a puzzle game created by Leon Balmaekers. The goal of this game is to place a tent next to each tree, without tents neighboring each other.

This is my approach recreating it with C++ and SFML. Currently it is not in a playable state and I work on it on and off in my freetime.
