# Unity Level Editor

This is a Level Editor for the Unity3D engine I built for my Bachelor dissertation.
<br/>
The source can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/grandauto3/UnityLevelEditor).

## Usage

![Pixel Editor](assets/images/pixel_editor.png)

Within the editor the level layout is drawn.

![Generated Level](assets/images/3d-scene.png)

Which then will be generated in the 3D scene with the selected prefabs.
