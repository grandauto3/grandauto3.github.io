# Unity Level Editor

This is a Level Editor for the Unity3D engine I built for my Bachelor degree.

## Usage

![Pixel Editor](resource:assets/images/pixel_editor.png#512x512)
Within this editor the level layout is drawn

![Generated Level](resource:assets/images/3d-scene.png#512x512)
Which then generates the level in the 3D scene with the selected prefabs.

The source can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/grandauto3/UnityLevelEditor)
